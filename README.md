# Visualizing-Netflix-Data-with-Amazon-QuickSight
Visualizing Netflix data and trends using Amazon QuickSight, linking S3 bucket data to QuickSight for comprehensive dashboard creation.

##Here's how I used Amazon QuickSight to visualise Netflix's catalogue trends 📊

🔍 Throughout this AWS project, I learned how to:
✅ Upload and store datasets in Amazon S3.
✅ Connect datasets to Amazon QuickSight for analysis.
✅ Create visualisations like donut charts, bar graphs, and tables.
✅ Answer complex data questions using QuickSight's functionalities.

🌟 The highlight of the project was putting all of these visualisations into one big dashboard - so satisfying to see them work together.

💼 This hands-on experience not only enhanced my AWS skills but also sharpened my data visualisation and analysis capabilities, essential in today's data-driven world.
